        <h4><font color="blue">Audio Control Buttons</font></h4>
        
        <p>
            Audio controls should mostly be self-explanatory with one exception. If you choose the USB mode, SD Card Mode or
            AUX mode without having USB, SD Card or Aux cable connected to the speaker, the speaker might switch to an FM radio mode.
            You can either provide the necessary connections for the mode you want to use or switch to Bluetooth mode where you can
            pair your phone with the speaker and stream your desired content to the speaker.
