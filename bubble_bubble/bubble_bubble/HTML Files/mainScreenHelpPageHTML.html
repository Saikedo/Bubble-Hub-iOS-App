            <b> Location Permissions: </b> This application might ask the user to grant access to device`s location on some of the newer Android phones.
            This permission is necessary to access the Bluetooth capabilities on some of the phones. This application does not collect any user data and
            we do not share or collect any location-based information from the phone. The permission is simply necessary for the application to be able
            to connect to the Bubble devices.
